# Contributing to Pinger

We politely ask that you keep these guidelines in mind while you journey through this projct:
 - [Issues and Bugs](#issue)
 - [Feature Requests](#feature)

## <a name="issue"></a> Found a Bug?

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by submitting an issue.
If you'd like, you can even submit a pull request with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> Missing a Feature?
You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our repository.
If you would like to implement a new feature, please consider the size of the change in order to determine the right steps to proceed:

* For a **Major Feature**, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be discussed.
  This process allows us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.

  **Note**: Adding a new topic to the documentation, or significantly re-writing a topic, counts as a major feature.

* **Small Features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a Pull Request](#submit-pr).
